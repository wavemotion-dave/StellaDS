StellaDS - PHOENIX EDITION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
StellaDS is an Atari 2600 (VCS) console emulator for your DS/DSi.
To use this emulator, you must use compatibles rom with a26/bin format. 
Twilight Menu++ wants to see the file extension be .a26 (you can just rename .bin)

Features :
----------
 High level of compatibility to make games playable. Most games you remember fondly
 run full speed on a DSi in native 133MHz mode. For the older DS-LITE and
 DS-PHAT, many of the simple 4k and 2k games will play perfectly and some of the 8k
 games will run very close to full speed. More sophisticated bank-switching schemes
 really require the DSi for the best experience.

 See compatibility.txt for a full list of the ROMS supported. Generally these are 
 going to be NTSC No-Intro roms (the good ones!). 

Installation:
------------
Copy StellaDS.nds to your flash cart or SD card of choice. Most launchers will
auto patch the game to run so you should be good to go... press on the CART slot
too pick and load a game (.bin or .a26). For some older launchers or flash-carts
you might need to DLDI patch the StellaDS.nds for your system (but it's unlikely
as most launchers will auto-patch when you run the emulator).

PAL vs NTSC:
------------
StellaDS supports PAL games but be warned... in the very early days of video
games, 99% of all games were developed as NTSC for the American Market and
only later ported to a PAL system for our European friends. Some game makers
did a good job (Imagic). Some did an OK job (Atari). And some did not do well
(Activision). That means that some games just don't run at the right speed 
for the PAL market - since Activision did not optiize for PAL, the games run
17% slower due to the frame rate difference. To make matters worse, the main
benefit of PAL is that the programmer has more scanlines to work with but the
DS only has 192 pixel rows... so with PAL we must compress the image and
that results in missing pixel rows. All of this to say: while PAL is supported
you are generally going to get the most genuine Atari 2600 experience with
NTSC roms. 

Missing :
---------
 DPC+ games can't be emulated - that requires a coprocessor running at 70MHz (more 
 than the speed of an original DS!).

To Alekmaul for porting Stella to the DS.
To Robz for Twilight-Menu++ which rekindled emulation on the classic handheld.

V2.8 : 11-Jun-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * A couple dozen micro-tweaks to the sound driver to squeeze out a bit more
    performance. Elevators Amiss is now running at 60FPS! All of the Starpath
    Supercharger games are running in the high 50s and many are at 60FPS.

V2.7 : 4-Jun-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * A few more games added to the compatibility list.
  * A minor optimization for fetching PC contents - yielding 1 or 2FPS in many games.

V2.6 : 3-Jun-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Fixed ability to scale/move screen with Paddle games.
  * Tweaked more than 100 game screen offsets to better center/show them by default.

V2.5 : 1-Jun-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Restored PAL palette selection when choosing a game.
  * Eeked out 1 or 2 FPS on Starpath Supercharger games by limiting the number
    of vertical scanlines we will show. Elevators Amiss is now close to 54FPS!

V2.4 : 31-May-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * A bit more juice squeezed out of the TIA. Added cart-specific options
    to bypass VerticalBlank zero (not all games need that memory cleared if
    we are dealing with a static screen... and this buys us CPU cycles!) and,
    somewhat more dangerously, HorizontalBlank clearing can be disabled for
    more speed. Only a few of the more stubborn games utilize these!
  * Removed PAL/NTSC option... only NTSC is supported (all games were released
    in NTSC except a dozen PAL exclusives which have long since been converted
    to run on NTSC - Search Atariage).
  * General cleanup and minor memory/code optimizations to get the most out 
    of the emulator.
  * Added 2 more lines of resolution before the top of the screen and 5 more
    below... this allows the games that utilize underscan and/or significant
    overscan to show properly.

V2.3 : 30-May-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * And more improvement/stramline of TIA rendering to give a 10% boost
    for most games 0 this brings Elevators Amiss up to 51FPS and Phaser
    Patrol to 55 with gusts up to 59FPS!
  
V2.2 : 29-May-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Improved handling of TIA to trade off a little bit of speed on the fast
    games to gain 10-15% speed boost on the hard-to-render games. This makes
    games like Fantastic Voyage, Super Breakout, Elevators Amiss and many 
    other games run much closer to full speed!

V2.1 : 23-Mar-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Improved Screen Scaling (using Left/Right shoulder buttons + Arrow Keys)
  * Fix for file selection bug
  * Minor cleanup and improvements to squeeze out the last bit of juice from the emulation!

V2.0 : 26-Jan-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Faster AR processing rendering some of the more stubborn games playable.
  * Faster screen rendering for more complicated games. Simple games take a small
    performance hit (think: games with solid backgrounds) but those were already 
    running plenty fast enough - to we took the trade off to make some of the 
    more complicated games faster - this is an overall win for most games!
  * General cleanup - more games rendering properly (screen offset/scaling tweaks).

V1.9 : 24-Jan-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Screen tweaks to more than 400 games to make them look as good as possible.
  * More games added to the compatibility table - many homebrews.
  * Faster AR (Starpath Supercharger) processing so more of those games are playable.

V1.8 : 19-Jan-2021 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Booster Grip Implemented (Omega Race and Thrust+ working)
  * Improved timing accuracy so games like Venture Reloaded work.
  * Implemented "AR" handling so Supercharger carts work.
  * Improved timing across the board... about 5% faster than 1.7
  * DPC+ Carts now recognized... and message will come up stating they are not supported.
  * L-TRIG+DPAD bumps screen offsets.   R-TRIG+DPAD changes Y-Scaling  

V1.7 : 31-Dec-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Very minor cleanup and polish.

V1.6 : 05-Dec-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Star Raiders working now.
  * All Tigervision (3F) games working.
  * Boulder Dash Demo V2 (3E game) works!
  * Minor graphical cleanups and better keypad touch input support.
  * Compatibility.txt list updated.

V1.5 : 05-Dec-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * General cleanup. Ready for wider distribution.

V1.1k : 04-Dec-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Added Sound Toggle. Off gets you 10% speed boost.
  
V1.1j : 03-Dec-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Added info icon.
  * Better handling of touch screen.
  * Skip drawing frames that are off-screen.
  * Fixed sound gliches long present in the emulator.
  * Fixed color for Barnstorming bars (more red, less purple).
  * Other optimizations as time allowed.

V1.1h : 01-Dec-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Added full paddle emulation via new Paddle Icon
  * Added Keyboard / Keypad emulation via new Keypad Icon
  * Added Driver Controller emulation (for Indy500 only for now)
  * More core cleanups and minor timing improvements
  * Rebranding PHEONIX EDITION

V1.1g : 29-Nov-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Added paddle support - use the stylus on the bottom of screen.
  * New ROM mapping table for most acurate position of screen and will
    automatically enable the right controller and Flicker Free mode.
  * Better and more accurate timing (helps FPS measurement)
  * Switched to using unused VRAM to help with DMA copies.
  * Left/Right trigger to position screen now happens during Vertical Blank (cleaner).

V1.1f : 28-Nov-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Switched to dual-channel DMA memory copy for frame buffer. Slight speed improvement.
  * New button handling. See button map below the history section.
  * Added Flicker-Free switch... please use with caution as this takes significant CPU 
    power to make work as it ORs the previous two frames to help with 30Hz flicker that
    some games produce (Stellar Track, Yars Revenge, Asteroids, etc). 
  * Added ability to shift the screen up and down by 1 pixel per press of the shoulder buttons.

V1.1e : 27-Nov-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Slight improvement on TIA speed (1-2% speed improvement on many games).
  * Correctly identify games that use the right joystick (Home Run, Surround, Air-Sea Battle, 
    Wizard of Wor, Basketball, Star Ship and Slot Racers) and switch the DS controls
    to compensate (those games were unplayable before this).
  * Added Compatibility.txt for a list of games and their framerates.

V1.1d : 26-Nov-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Improved bank switching algorithm to speed it up. Makes F6/F8 games faster.
  * Improved speed in Pitfall II. Up to about 45 FPS - almost (but not quite) playable.
  * Faster display of ROMs list.
  * Emulator Version number now on ROM selection list.

V1.1c : 25-Nov-2020 by Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion)
  * Starting with RocketRobz 2-Apr-2020 baseline Stella DS codebase... 
  * Added graphical difficulty switches for both Left and Right players.
  * Used  a bit more of the DSi screen resolution so that the occasional missing graphic doesn't get 
    compressed away (e.g. if you fire the laser in Chopper Command you can see it sometimes disappears at 
    certain vertical positions of the Chopper... this is no longer an issue). Generally this results in a
    few missing rows of pixels at the very bottom of the screen which is a better trade-off for 95% of 
    games where almost no action takes place at the extremes.
  * Fixed all the on-screen touch button handling such that it's not so glitchy... press SELECT switch or
    START switch and it actually works every time (it's amazing what a little debounce code will do!). 
    I increased the hot-spots where you can press for each switch so that you can cleanly operate it with
    a finger or thumb... I hated getting out the Stylus for the small hit-boxes that were originally used.
  * Improved the emulator core to reorder a few operations, streamline a few others and one semi-major hack 
    that I'm not proud of to use a global integer for CPU cycles to avoid any structure/class overhead which
    yields a 5-15% speedup (depending on the game).  More games now run full speed and other games are elevated
    to "playable" with these speed improvements. 
  * Start and Select buttons now map to RESET (often used to start a game) and SELECT switches. That only seems logical. 
  * Remapped the FPS display to the right shoulder switch. I also only output the FPS once per second instead of 
    the wasteful 60x per second which means you can run with the FPS enabled with very little (but not zero!) impact on emulation.
  * Press (and hold) the left shoulder switch to run the game at max speed... some games run at 120FPS max and others can't even get to 60... but it's improving!
  * The Power Off button no longer makes that hideous screeching noise. And if you decide not to quit, it renders the screen back properly.
  * Fixed the ROM loading problems when the filenames were > 29 characters long.
  * Other minor improvements as time allowed...
